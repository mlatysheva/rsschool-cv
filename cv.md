> I am a self-taught IT enthusiast. In 2020, I completed Front-End Developer and Data Analyst nanodegree courses at [Udacity](https://udacity.com). I studied HTML, CSS, Javascript (including ES6), Node.js, Webpack, Git, Python and SQL. I completed a number of projects in Front End and Data Analysis. You can see them here: https://github.com/mlatysheva. I am currently taking the zeroeth and second stages of the Javascript/Front-End Development at [Rolling Scopes School](https://rs.school). I have many years of in-office and self-employed work experience, mainly in translations, accounting and IT support. Now I would very much like to pursue a career in IT and I am not afraid of starting from a junior position or internship. I am mature, attentive to detail and responsible, as well as a reliable and positive team player. I learn fast and will be happy to acquire any missing knowledge from more experienced colleagues to become a truly valuable member of your team.
